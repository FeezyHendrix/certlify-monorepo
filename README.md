## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
